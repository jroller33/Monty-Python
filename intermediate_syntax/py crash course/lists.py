# lists are mutable in python

# ---  list methods:

def list_methods():
    fruits = ["Pineapple", "Apple", "Banana", "Orange", "Mango"]
    fruits.append("Kiwi")
    print(fruits)
    fruits.insert(0, "orange")
    print(fruits)
    
    # normally you'd either add to the beginning with insert(0) or the end with append()
