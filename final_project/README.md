# Script to create log files from events

this was the final project for my python crash course

given a list of events that are instances of the Event class, sort the list and generate a log file that lists all users currently logged in, and what machine they're logged into. Only list the users that are currently logged in, based on the events given.

`current_users.log` is the log generated from running `script.py`

`event.py` defines the Event class and the list of events
