# Common sequence operations
# Lists and tuples are both sequences and they share a number of sequence operations. The following common sequence operations are used by both lists and tuples:

# len(sequence) - Returns the length of the sequence.

# for element in sequence - Iterates over each element in the sequence.

# if element in sequence - Checks whether the element is part of the sequence.

# sequence[x] - Accesses the element at index [x] of the sequence, starting at zero

# sequence[x:y] - Accesses a slice starting at index [x], ending at index [y-1]. If [x] is omitted, the index will start at 0 by default. If [y] is omitted, the len(sequence) will set the ending index position by default.

# for index, element in enumerate(sequence) - Iterates over both the indices and the elements in the sequence at the same time.

# List-specific operations and methods
# One major difference between lists and tuples is that lists are mutable (changeable) and tuples are immutable (not changeable). There are a few operations and methods that are specific to changing data within lists:

# list[index] = x - Replaces the element at index [n] with x.

# list.append(x) - Appends x to the end of the list.

# list.insert(index, x) - Inserts x at index position [index].

# list.pop(index) - Returns the element at [index] and removes it from the list. If [index] position is not in the list, the last element in the list is returned and removed.

# list.remove(x) - Removes the first occurrence of x in the list.

# list.sort() - Sorts the items in the list.

# list.reverse() - Reverses the order of items of the list.

# list.clear() - Deletes all items in the list.

# list.copy() - Creates a copy of the list.

# list.extend(other_list) - Appends all the elements of other_list at the end of list

# List comprehensions
# A list comprehension is an efficient method for creating a new list from a sequence or a range in a single line of code. It is a best practice to add descriptive comments about any list comprehensions used in your code, as their purpose can be difficult to interpret by other coders.

# [expression for variable in sequence] - Creates a new list based on the given sequence. Each element in the new list is the result of the given expression.

# Example: my_list = [ x*2 for x in range(1,11) ]

# [expression for variable in sequence if condition] - Creates a new list based on a specified sequence. Each element is the result of the given expression; elements are added only if the specified condition is true. 

# Example: my_list = [ x for x in range(1,101) if x % 10 == 0 ]
