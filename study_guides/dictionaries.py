# my_dictionary = {keyA:value1,value2, keyB:value3,value4}

# Operations
# len(dictionary) - Returns the number of items in a dictionary.

# for key in dictionary - Iterates over each key in a dictionary.

# for key, value in dictionary.items() - Iterates over each key,value pair in a dictionary.

# if key in dictionary - Checks whether a key is in a dictionary.

# dictionary[key] - Accesses a value using the associated key from a dictionary.

# dictionary[key] = value - Sets a value associated with a key.

# del dictionary[key] - Removes a value using the associated key from a dictionary.


# Methods
# dictionary.get(key, default) - Returns the value corresponding to a key, or the default value if the specified key is not present.

# dictionary.keys() - Returns a sequence containing the keys in a dictionary.

# dictionary.values() - Returns a sequence containing the values in a dictionary.

# dictionary[key].append(value) - Appends a new value for an existing key.

# dictionary.update(other_dictionary) - Updates a dictionary with the items from another dictionary. Existing entries are replaced; new entries are added.

# dictionary.clear() - Deletes all items from a dictionary.

# dictionary.copy() - Makes a copy of a dictionary.


# Dictionaries versus Lists 
# Dictionaries are similar to lists, but there are a few differences:

# Both dictionaries and lists:
# are used to organize elements into collections;

# are used to initialize a new dictionary or list, use empty brackets;

# can iterate through the items or elements in the collection; and

# can use a variety of methods and operations to create and change the collections, like removing and inserting items or elements.

# Dictionaries only:
# are unordered sets;

# have keys that can be a variety of data types, including strings, integers, floats, tuples;.

# can access dictionary values by keys;

# use square brackets inside curly brackets { [ ] };

# use colons between the key and the value(s);

# use commas to separate each key group and each value within a key group;

# make it quicker and easier for a Python interpreter to find specific elements, as compared to a list.

# Lists only:
# are ordered sets;

# access list elements by index positions;

# require that these indices be integers;

# use square brackets [ ];



# Dictionary Example:

pet_dictionary = {"dogs": ["Yorkie", "Collie", "Bulldog"], "cats": ["Persian", "Scottish Fold", "Siberian"], "rabbits": ["Angora", "Holland Lop", "Harlequin"]}  


print(pet_dictionary.get("dogs", 0))
# Should print ['Yorkie', 'Collie', 'Bulldog']
