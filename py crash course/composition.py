# ALWAYS INITIALIZE MUTABLE ATTRIBUTES IN THE CONSTRUCTOR

# if two different classes are related, but there's no inheritance, this is called composition- where one class uses code from another class.

# in the example below, there's a Package class that rep's a software package.
# there's also a Repository class, which contains all the packages available
# there's no inheritance, but they're related bc Repository contains a dicitonary or list of Packages that are contained in the repo.

class Repository:
    def __init__(self):
        self.packages = {}  # initialize packages dictionary

# initialize the dictionary in the constructor so every instance of the Repository class has its own dictionary.

    def add_package(self, package):
        """
        takes Package object as a parameter, and then adds it to the dictionary, using the package name attribute as the key."""
        self.packages[package.name] = package

    def total_size(self):
        """
        computes the total size of all packages contained in our repository
        """
        result = 0

        for package in self.package.values():
            result += package.size
        return result

    # weâ€™re making use of Package attributes within our Repository class 
    # and the values() method on our packages dictionary instance. 
    # Composition allows us to use objects as attributes, as well as access all their attributes and methods.
